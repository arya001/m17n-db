(input-method t lsymbol)

(description (_"Input method for symbols with relatively longer key sequences.
All key sequences start with the key \"/\".
This input methods is registered as one of fallback input methods by default.
If you prefer shorter key sequences, try \"ssymbol\"."))

; Some guidelines for determining shortcut sequences:
;  * Where appropriate, provide access to a broad category of symbols by using the technique of showing multiple alternatives based on the starter keys pressed (eg: face, hand and heart symbols below).
;    * The user can easily select the appropriate symbol using ↑,↓,→,← (or C-p, C-n, C-f, C-b) keys and the digits.
;    * Prefer restricting the size of a character cluster to 6 - so that the user can use digits more accessible to the left hand, with arrow keys using the right hand. For example, prefer "♥♡💔💖💘💓" "💞💕💌" to "♥♡💔💖💘💓💞💕💌".
;    * Within a group (say hand gestures), cluster semantically similar symbols together.
;  * Keyboard shortcuts used in popular applications provide clues as to what the appropriate

; Some references:
; * Some statistics are available online. Example http://www.scribd.com/doc/262594751/SwiftKey-Emoji-Report (guardian highlight) and http://emojitracker.com/ . Although, this is biased towards populations who are already tech savvy + have the time to type emojis easily and does not give as much weight to people who are just beginning to use IM/ digital communication.
; * There are other indications of popularity - such as other products (say MS Office or Facebook or Google Hangouts, who would presumably have adapted towards user expectations) providing shortcuts for these emoji-s.
